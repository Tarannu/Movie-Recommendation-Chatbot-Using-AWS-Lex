# Movie-Recommendation-Chatbot-Using-AWS-Lex

This repository will provide you the lambda functions which are needed for AWS lex intent creation. For each function  written in the handler.js file, a corresponding intent with slot values has to be created in the AWS lex interface.For the API used for retrieving movie information, I have used The Movie DB webstie(https://www.themoviedb.org/).For better understanding, you can follow this series of three video tutorials, which I used for basic learning.
